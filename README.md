# Factorial Generator (C++)

A simple C++ program that calculates the factorial of a number entered by the user.  
The program shows each step of the calculation with a short delay for better visualization.

---

## Description
This program takes a non-negative integer as input and prints its factorial.  
It demonstrates the use of loops, basic validation, and timing delay using `<thread>` and `<chrono>`.

---

## Example Output
``` bash
Factorial Generator
Enter a positive integer: 5

Processing...

Calculating: 1! = 1
Calculating: 2! = 2
Calculating: 3! = 6
Calculating: 4! = 24
Calculating: 5! = 120

The factorial of 5 is: 120
```

## How to Compile and Run
1. Save the file as `factorial.cpp`.
2. Open your terminal or command prompt in the file directory.
3. Compile the program using:
``` bash
g++ factorial.cpp -o factorial
```
``` bash
